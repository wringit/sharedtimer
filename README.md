# Shared Timer

## Background
This was a project created for HackPSU 2025. The idea behind the project is to let users accross different devices access the same timer, which they can start and stop as they please. 

## What we used
We used Python (specifically Flask) for the timer and server, and Javascript for the front end.


## Running
To run Shared Timer on your computer, clone the repository and run app.py.
